# Overview

We are the local R user group for Johannesburg, South Africa.
R is an open source programming language for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualization (http://www.r-project.org/). R has a very huge user community worldwide, and its user base is growing exponentially. While most commonly used within academia, in fields such as computational biology and applied statistics, it is gaining currency in commercial areas such as quantitative finance and business intelligence.

Our goal is to support and share R experiences and knowledge among its users in the Johannesburg community. We would like to hear how you use and enjoy the R language and statistical programming environment. We would also like to inspire new users to learn R.
