["index.html", "Johannesburg R User Group Overview Technical bit Original source", " Johannesburg R User Group Overview This site attempts to list R conferences and local useR groups. Please feel free to add any missing group or conference. In particular, most of the associated twitter names are missing. There are currently 96 R user groups and events. To propose a change, just click the pencil icon in the top left hand corner. Keep up to date by following @rstats_meetings. This list is maintained by Jumping Rivers. We also maintain a corresponding list of Data Science conferences and events. Technical bit The html files for this document live in the docs/ directory of the repository. Travis creates the html files from the .Rmd files and commits them to the docs/ directory. I’ve created a couple of R scripts to help maintain this list. One checks the URL return code 200, the other counts the number of groups. Original source The original list of useR groups was compiled by David Smith at Revolution Analytics blog. "],
